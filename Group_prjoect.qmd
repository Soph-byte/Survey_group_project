The analysis shows clear differences in support for various aspects of LGBT+ rights. It is particularly noticeable that both transgender-relevant topics and LGB rights tend to be rated positively overall, but with certain differences in the intensity of approval. The average agreement with the possibility of transgender people being able to adapt their official documents to their gender identity (qc19) is 1.59. This indicates that a majority of respondents are in favor of this measure, although “Don't Know” responses could play a role. The introduction of a third gender option on official documents (qc20) received slightly less approval with an average value of 1.72, which indicates that this measure is discussed somewhat more controversially.

In comparison, the values for the general equality of LGB people (qc15_1,, qc15_2 , qc15_3) are more on the approving side of the scale with average values between 2.17 and 2.38 (1 = strongly approve, 5 = strongly disapprove). This means that the majority of respondents tend to agree with these statements. However, the values are not extremely low, which indicates that there is still a certain skepticism or reluctance in parts of the population.

Identifiying how much people choosed the third option: i dont know in percentage:

```{r}
dk_percentage <- legal_framework_data %>%
  summarise(
    qc19 = sum(qc19 == 3, na.rm = TRUE) / n() * 100,
    qc20 = sum(qc20 == 3, na.rm = TRUE) / n() * 100
  )

dk_percentage

```

qc19 (Transgender people should be able to adapt official documents) → 11.95% qc20 (Third gender option in official documents) → 11.62%

Country differences:

```{r}

dk_summary <- legal_framework_data %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(
    DK_qc19 = sum(qc19 == 3, na.rm = TRUE) / n() * 100,
    DK_qc20 = sum(qc20 == 3, na.rm = TRUE) / n() * 100
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(DK_qc19, DK_qc20), names_to = "Question", values_to = "DK_Percentage")

```

-\> yyou can see clear differences in the response rates. While in bulgaria every 5. person selected "dont know" for transgender document change (qc19) in Belgium only less than 5% choosed this option.

Results: The Netherlands (88%), Spain (76%) and Malta (76%) are the countries with the highest approval ratings.Countries such as Germany (62%), Sweden (62%) and Austria (57%) also show a majority in favor of changing the law, but at a lower level than the frontrunners. In these countries, there appears to be ongoing social debate and differing opinions. Bulgaria (12%), Hungary (14%), Romania (22%) and Slovakia (24%) have the lowest approval ratings.

Because there arent so many variables for legal framework, we included the lgtb-rights index-data. The Data is from: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/lgbt-rights-index?time=2012&region=Europe The index captures to which extent LGBT+ people have the same rights as straight and cisgender people. It combines 18 individual policies, such as the legality of same-sex relationships, marriage, and gender marker changes. Higher values indicate more rights, negative values regressive policies progressive policies receiving a positive score and regressive policies receiving a negative score: -5 to +13. Among the progressive policies are: Same-sex sexual acts Legal, Equal Age of Consent, Employment Discrimination, Hate Crime Protections, Incitement to Hatred, Civil Unions, Marriage Equality, oint Adoptions, Gender Marker Change, LGB Military, Transgender Military, Ban on Conversion Therapies, and Ban on Gender Assignment Surgeries on Children

Malta has the highest score, well above all other countries. Scandinavian & Western European countries (Sweden, Netherlands, UK, Germany, France) have relatively high values. Eastern European countries (Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary) have the lowest values in the LGBT Index.

We wanted to investigate whether there are significant differences in the laws in different parts of Europe. We therefore divided the countries into Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern Europe and compared the LGTB score.

```{r}
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
    country_name %in% c("Denmark", "Sweden", "Finland", "Estonia", "Latvia", "Lithuania") ~ "Northern Europe",
    country_name %in% c("Germany", "France", "Netherlands", "Belgium", "Luxembourg", 
                        "United Kingdom", "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",  
                        "Ireland", "Austria") ~ "Western Europe",
    country_name %in% c("Spain", "Italy", "Portugal", "Greece", "Malta", "Cyprus") ~ "Southern Europe",
    country_name %in% c("Poland", "Hungary", "Czech Republic", "Slovakia", "Romania", 
                        "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Slovenia") ~ "Eastern Europe",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))


ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = region, y = LGBT..Policy.Index, fill = region)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "LGBT Policy Index by Region",
       x = "Region", y = "LGBT Policy Index") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


             
```

Western Europe has the highest LGBT index, with a high median and a relatively small range. Northern Europe shows a large variance, with some countries having very high values and others in the middle. Southern Europe is lower overall than Northern and Western Europe, with a wide range of values. Eastern Europe has the lowest values, with a median of around 5 and lower protection rights for LGBT people.

```{r}
anova_result <- aov(LGBT..Policy.Index ~ region, data = merged_data)
summary(anova_result)
```

The ANOVA analysis shows a highly significant difference between the regions (p \< 2e-16), which means that the differences in the LGBT index between the regions are statistically significant.

Interpretation: LGBT policy differs systematically between the regions, with Western Europe and Northern Europe having significantly higher values than Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.

```{r}
cor_data <- merged_data %>%
  select(qc19, qc20, qc15_1, qc15_2, qc15_3,LGBT..Policy.Index) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric))  

cor_matrix <- cor(cor_data, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

print(cor_matrix)

ggcorrplot(cor_matrix, method = "circle", type = "lower",
           lab = TRUE, lab_size = 4, colors = c("red", "white", "blue"),
           title = "Correlation Matrix of Selected Variables")
             
```

The correlation table highlights interesting connections between societal views on LGBTI+ rights and the LGBT Policy Index. The strongest positive correlation appears between these variables: qc15_1 which gauges equal rights for LGB people; qc15_2 which measures acceptance of same-sex relationships; and qc15_3 which covers marriage equality. These values range from 0.75 to 0.82. It indicates that nations with high acceptance of LGB rights generally back marriage equality too. There's a moderate correlation between qc19 which covers support for transgender document changes and qc20 which deals with a third gender option, clocking in at 0.59. This suggests that countries with advanced laws for trans people often favor a third gender option on official documents as well. But the correlations between qc19/qc20 and general LGBTI+ attitudes ‒ qc15\_\* ‒ are moderate (0.33–0.43). A positive attitude towards LGB rights often occurs alongside supportive views on trans issues.

```{r}

lm_model <- lm(LGBT..Policy.Index ~ qc19 + qc20 + qc15_1 + qc15_2 + qc15_3, data = merged_data)

summary(lm_model)
```

The results show that approval of LGBT rights is strongly associated with a higher LGBT Policy Index. the strongest negative effects come from rejection of “marriage for all” (-1.76 points) and same-sex relationships (-0.94 points). neutral answers (“don't know”) are often as negative as rejection - uncertainty is therefore a strong signal for less legal protection of LGBT+ rights. the transgender-specific questions (qc19, qc20) are also significant, but with somewhat weaker effects than LGB rights. the model is significant, but only explains approx. 26.5% of the variance - other factors also play a role.
